    intro: "Our skin is a remarkably sophisticated organ that serves as more than just a means of protection from the elements. And while water and air pollution can harm the skin's appearance and functionality, there are steps we can do to lessen the impact.\\n",
    content: "5 tips to Protect Skin from Pollution \\nWatch out for air pollution: Premature ageing of the skin is a result of airborne pollutants, notably on the hands, neck, and face. The UV radiation from the sun can interact with smog, pollution, and dust, producing free radicals that reduce the oxygen in skin cells and impair collagen synthesis. Because they damage cells and deteriorate DNA, these highly charged oxygen molecules are bad for the skin and the body. This can make skin look drab and grey and cause wrinkles, rough spots, and acne. Skin allergies, eczema, and blood vessel damage can all result from prolonged exposure. Wash your face every day, exfoliate your skin twice a week, and moisturise every day to protect your skin. According to studies, using antioxidant-rich goods, like green tea, may help reduce skin pollution.\\nLimit your exposure to chlorine: It is harmful and can cause major irritation to your skin and lungs even though it is used to purify drinking water. Over time, the consequences can be detrimental even at tiny doses. When you take a shower, heat causes your pores to open, allowing chlorine to soak in and remove natural oils from your skin while also drying it out, which can cause wrinkles. Spend less time in chlorinated water, such as swimming pools.\\nDon't do it to yourself: Simply put, smoking contributes to air pollution. Both first-hand and second-hand smoke can cause health problems. By constricting the blood vessels in your skin, it restricts blood flow to your skin, depleting oxygen and vital nutrients while also causing wrinkles. The fibres that give skin its flexibility and might lead it to wrinkle prematurely, elastin and collagen, are also harmed by smoking. Free radicals from cigarette and cigar smoke are a significant source of skin ageing and further skin damage.\\nBlock the pollution: Pollution is impossible to totally avoid if you reside in a developed nation, but there are measures to lessen its impacts. Overexposure to UV radiation can result in skin cancer and wrinkles. A quality moisturiser moisturises the skin and fortifies it against pollution and free radicals. Wear sunscreen on your face and neck and take a daily vitamin C supplement to protect yourself.\\nStay hydrated: One of the most abundant substances on Earth is also one of the finest defences in the fight for healthy skin. Water moisturises the skin, promotes cell growth, enhances circulation, reduces under-eye circles, and increases skin flexibility. You can filter your drinking water to get rid of chlorine and other chemicals to protect your skin from the impacts of water pollution. Your skin can be cleaned of air contaminants by washing it twice a day and exfoliating once a week. To avoid the possibly harmful effects of chlorine in tap water, think about switching to mineral water.\\nAs we age, our skin naturally starts to lose moisture and suppleness, but by implementing some of these strategies, we can stop pollutants from quickening the process.\\n\\nVisit the websites and other resources on the following page to find out more about how to shield your skin from pollution.",

    title: "9 Toxic Ingredients in Your Hair Dyes To Avoid",
    slug: "9-toxic-ingredients-in-your-hair-dyes-to-avoid",
    intro: "We experimented with colouring our hair, much like the majority of people who have been in seclusion for the past 18 months. We used bright violets, ashy greys, and brilliant pinks in our dye tests. Even though they were beautiful, we managed to ignore the fact that the substances in the hair colour were hazardous and did more harm than we had anticipated.",
    content: "While the majority of hair colours and dyes are safe to use, some of them include dangerous chemicals that can affect the hair over time and make\\n it dry, brittle, and even unhealthy. So use this as a PSA on learning hair colour and its dangerous elements if you intend to colour your hair.\\n \\n • Ammonia: Ammonia should be avoided at all costs because it is most likely the main factor in hair damage. Unfortunately, because it also exists in the form of its metabolites, ethanolamine, diethanolamine, and triethanolamine, it is also the most widespread. This alkaline chemical may aid in the proper absorption of the colour into the hair, but the result is dry, brittle, and unhealthful hair. Additionally, it smells terrible and irritates the nose and eyes, which can eventually lead to serious infections.\\n \\n • Paraphenylenediamine (PPD): The current pigment in the hair is removed by PPD, allowing the new colour to replace it. The poisonous substance, which is also known to be carcinogenic, can cause rhabdomyolysis, respiratory failure, and cardiac health problems if it is exposed to large amounts.\\n \\n • Para-toluenediamine (PTD): According to research, a concerning amount of PTD is absorbed via the skin as a person ages. This chemical can trigger allergies in hair stylists in addition to being harmful to the individual getting their hair coloured.\\n \\n • Peroxide: Peroxide, or hydrogen peroxide, is often used as a substitute for bleach since it's believed to be less harsh. Unfortunately, there's no truth to this widely held belief since lightening your hair with peroxide causes long-term cuticle damage, leading to frizz, split ends, and even breakage in the long run.\\n \\n • Resorcinol: Resorcinol is a chemical that shouldn't be used carelessly because it can affect not only your scalp but also your general health. It is flammable, can cause abdominal pain when inhaled, and can produce redness when it comes into contact with skin, which qualifies it as a hazardous chemical. Resorcinol is a known hormone disruptor with the potential to cause thyroid malfunction and harm your central nervous system, in addition to these allergic symptoms.\\n \\n • Quaternium-15: Make sure your hair colour doesn't contain quaternium-15 by checking the label. This substance is a well-known allergy and is found as a preservative in numerous cosmetic and hair products. According to Mahalli, it releases formaldehyde, which might cause a contact dermatitis reaction in susceptible individuals.\\n \\n • Sulphates: Sulphates have a long history of being bad for haircare, so we all saw this one coming. In case you didn't know, certain hair dyes contain sulphates to keep your mane tidy. However, sulphates can leave your hair incredibly weak, brittle, and prone to breaking when used in conjunction with bleach (which you'll need to if you're colouring your hair lighter).\\n \\n • Titanium Dioxide: You shouldn't be too concerned about titanium dioxide, a mineral that is used as a pigment in hair colouring products, but it is still wise to stay away from it. Although it's frequently found in sunscreens and is generally regarded as safe, it can be carcinogenic when inhaled in big doses, which is what happens when hair dye is applied.\\n \\n • Paraphenylenediamine: We won't lie: this chemical is a hassle to be around and its name is a pain to say. Because it enables the new colour to replace the old pigment, paraphenylenediamine, or PPD, is widely used in dyes. However, did you know that it is a chemical that can cause cancer? That implies that over exposure to it can result in side effects like respiratory failure and cardiac health problems. Yikes. PS: You don't have to toss away all of your dyes and stop using hair colours altogether just because you've read this list. You probably won't hurt yourself when used in very little, moderate amounts. Try to stay away from these ingredients as much as you can, though, just to be cautious. Instead, choose natural substances like henna, carrot, arnica, etc. that are sourced from plants. Have fun colouring!",

    slug: "5-ways-to-prevent-wrinkling",
    intro: "Aging is a fact. And like many other adults, you may be wondering if there is anything you can do to stop the ageing process from showing on your skin. It's one of the most often asked questions dermatologists receive, claims dermatologist Melissa Piliang, MD. But there's good news, she says. You can actually take a lot of steps to stop your skin from ageing. Just make a commitment to them. Here are four measures you may take to protect your skin from the effects of time.",
    content: "1. Protect your skin from the sun: UV radiation exposure accelerates the ageing process of your skin, leading to wrinkles and blotchy, rough skin. In actuality, sun exposure is the main cause of wrinkles, uneven pigmentation, and other skin ageing symptoms. By limiting the amount of time you spend in the sun and by always wearing protective clothing and a hat, you may protect your skin and avoid developing wrinkles in the future. Additionally, wear sunscreen outside on exposed skin all year round. \\n \\n2. Select items with built-in sunscreen: Choose skin care items with a minimum SPF of 15 when making your selection. SPF of 30 or above is advised by the American Academy of Dermatology. Use items that are water resistant and broad spectrum, which means they prevent UVA and UVB rays. Reapply sunscreen every two hours, or more frequently if you're swimming or perspiring. Apply sunscreen liberally. \\n\\n3. Use moisturizers: Although they can't stop wrinkles from forming, moisturisers can temporarily hide fine lines and creases by holding water in the skin.\\n\\n4. Don't smoke: The blood vessels in the topmost layers of your skin become narrowed as a result of smoking. Collagen and elastin, the fibres that give your skin strength and elasticity, are also harmed by it. Skin starts to sag and wrinkle as a result before it should. Even if you've smoked for a long time or frequently, stopping smoking will still enhance the texture and tone of your skin and delay the appearance of wrinkles.\\n\\n5. Eat a healthy, well-balanced diet: According to the results of a few studies, eating a lot of fresh fruits and vegetables may help avoid the harm that causes early skin ageing. Research findings also point to the possibility that a diet high in sugar or other refined carbs may hasten ageing.\\n\\nA dermatologist can assist you in developing a customised skin care regimen by determining your skin type, assessing the health of your skin, and recommending products that are likely to be successful. A dermatologist can suggest prescription creams, botulinum toxin (Botox) injections, or skin-resurfacing procedures if you want more dramatic results from your wrinkle treatments.",
