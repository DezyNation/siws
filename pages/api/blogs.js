    intro: "Our skin is a remarkably sophisticated organ that serves as more than just a means of protection from the elements. And while water and air pollution can harm the skin's appearance and functionality, there are steps we can do to lessen the impact.\\n",
    content: "5 tips to Protect Skin from Pollution \\nWatch out for air pollution: Premature ageing of the skin is a result of airborne pollutants, notably on the hands, neck, and face. The UV radiation from the sun can interact with smog, pollution, and dust, producing free radicals that reduce the oxygen in skin cells and impair collagen synthesis. Because they damage cells and deteriorate DNA, these highly charged oxygen molecules are bad for the skin and the body. This can make skin look drab and grey and cause wrinkles, rough spots, and acne. Skin allergies, eczema, and blood vessel damage can all result from prolonged exposure. Wash your face every day, exfoliate your skin twice a week, and moisturise every day to protect your skin. According to studies, using antioxidant-rich goods, like green tea, may help reduce skin pollution.\\nLimit your exposure to chlorine: It is harmful and can cause major irritation to your skin and lungs even though it is used to purify drinking water. Over time, the consequences can be detrimental even at tiny doses. When you take a shower, heat causes your pores to open, allowing chlorine to soak in and remove natural oils from your skin while also drying it out, which can cause wrinkles. Spend less time in chlorinated water, such as swimming pools.\\nDon't do it to yourself: Simply put, smoking contributes to air pollution. Both first-hand and second-hand smoke can cause health problems. By constricting the blood vessels in your skin, it restricts blood flow to your skin, depleting oxygen and vital nutrients while also causing wrinkles. The fibres that give skin its flexibility and might lead it to wrinkle prematurely, elastin and collagen, are also harmed by smoking. Free radicals from cigarette and cigar smoke are a significant source of skin ageing and further skin damage.\\nBlock the pollution: Pollution is impossible to totally avoid if you reside in a developed nation, but there are measures to lessen its impacts. Overexposure to UV radiation can result in skin cancer and wrinkles. A quality moisturiser moisturises the skin and fortifies it against pollution and free radicals. Wear sunscreen on your face and neck and take a daily vitamin C supplement to protect yourself.\\nStay hydrated: One of the most abundant substances on Earth is also one of the finest defences in the fight for healthy skin. Water moisturises the skin, promotes cell growth, enhances circulation, reduces under-eye circles, and increases skin flexibility. You can filter your drinking water to get rid of chlorine and other chemicals to protect your skin from the impacts of water pollution. Your skin can be cleaned of air contaminants by washing it twice a day and exfoliating once a week. To avoid the possibly harmful effects of chlorine in tap water, think about switching to mineral water.\\nAs we age, our skin naturally starts to lose moisture and suppleness, but by implementing some of these strategies, we can stop pollutants from quickening the process.\\n\\nVisit the websites and other resources on the following page to find out more about how to shield your skin from pollution.",

    title: "9 Toxic Ingredients in Your Hair Dyes To Avoid",
    slug: "9-toxic-ingredients-in-your-hair-dyes-to-avoid",
    intro: "We experimented with colouring our hair, much like the majority of people who have been in seclusion for the past 18 months. We used bright violets, ashy greys, and brilliant pinks in our dye tests. Even though they were beautiful, we managed to ignore the fact that the substances in the hair colour were hazardous and did more harm than we had anticipated.",
    content: "While the majority of hair colours and dyes are safe to use, some of them include dangerous chemicals that can affect the hair over time and make\\n it dry, brittle, and even unhealthy. So use this as a PSA on learning hair colour and its dangerous elements if you intend to colour your hair.\\n \\n • Ammonia: Ammonia should be avoided at all costs because it is most likely the main factor in hair damage. Unfortunately, because it also exists in the form of its metabolites, ethanolamine, diethanolamine, and triethanolamine, it is also the most widespread. This alkaline chemical may aid in the proper absorption of the colour into the hair, but the result is dry, brittle, and unhealthful hair. Additionally, it smells terrible and irritates the nose and eyes, which can eventually lead to serious infections.\\n \\n • Paraphenylenediamine (PPD): The current pigment in the hair is removed by PPD, allowing the new colour to replace it. The poisonous substance, which is also known to be carcinogenic, can cause rhabdomyolysis, respiratory failure, and cardiac health problems if it is exposed to large amounts.\\n \\n • Para-toluenediamine (PTD): According to research, a concerning amount of PTD is absorbed via the skin as a person ages. This chemical can trigger allergies in hair stylists in addition to being harmful to the individual getting their hair coloured.\\n \\n • Peroxide: Peroxide, or hydrogen peroxide, is often used as a substitute for bleach since it's believed to be less harsh. Unfortunately, there's no truth to this widely held belief since lightening your hair with peroxide causes long-term cuticle damage, leading to frizz, split ends, and even breakage in the long run.\\n \\n • Resorcinol: Resorcinol is a chemical that shouldn't be used carelessly because it can affect not only your scalp but also your general health. It is flammable, can cause abdominal pain when inhaled, and can produce redness when it comes into contact with skin, which qualifies it as a hazardous chemical. Resorcinol is a known hormone disruptor with the potential to cause thyroid malfunction and harm your central nervous system, in addition to these allergic symptoms.\\n \\n • Quaternium-15: Make sure your hair colour doesn't contain quaternium-15 by checking the label. This substance is a well-known allergy and is found as a preservative in numerous cosmetic and hair products. According to Mahalli, it releases formaldehyde, which might cause a contact dermatitis reaction in susceptible individuals.\\n \\n • Sulphates: Sulphates have a long history of being bad for haircare, so we all saw this one coming. In case you didn't know, certain hair dyes contain sulphates to keep your mane tidy. However, sulphates can leave your hair incredibly weak, brittle, and prone to breaking when used in conjunction with bleach (which you'll need to if you're colouring your hair lighter).\\n \\n • Titanium Dioxide: You shouldn't be too concerned about titanium dioxide, a mineral that is used as a pigment in hair colouring products, but it is still wise to stay away from it. Although it's frequently found in sunscreens and is generally regarded as safe, it can be carcinogenic when inhaled in big doses, which is what happens when hair dye is applied.\\n \\n • Paraphenylenediamine: We won't lie: this chemical is a hassle to be around and its name is a pain to say. Because it enables the new colour to replace the old pigment, paraphenylenediamine, or PPD, is widely used in dyes. However, did you know that it is a chemical that can cause cancer? That implies that over exposure to it can result in side effects like respiratory failure and cardiac health problems. Yikes. PS: You don't have to toss away all of your dyes and stop using hair colours altogether just because you've read this list. You probably won't hurt yourself when used in very little, moderate amounts. Try to stay away from these ingredients as much as you can, though, just to be cautious. Instead, choose natural substances like henna, carrot, arnica, etc. that are sourced from plants. Have fun colouring!",

    intro: "Aging is a fact. And like many other adults, you may be wondering if there is anything you can do to stop the ageing process from showing on your skin. It's one of the most often asked questions dermatologists receive, claims dermatologist Melissa Piliang, MD. But there's good news, she says. You can actually take a lot of steps to stop your skin from ageing. Just make a commitment to them. Here are four measures you may take to protect your skin from the effects of time.",
    content: "1. Protect your skin from the sun: UV radiation exposure accelerates the ageing process of your skin, leading to wrinkles and blotchy, rough skin. In actuality, sun exposure is the main cause of wrinkles, uneven pigmentation, and other skin ageing symptoms. By limiting the amount of time you spend in the sun and by always wearing protective clothing and a hat, you may protect your skin and avoid developing wrinkles in the future. Additionally, wear sunscreen outside on exposed skin all year round. \\n \\n2. Select items with built-in sunscreen: Choose skin care items with a minimum SPF of 15 when making your selection. SPF of 30 or above is advised by the American Academy of Dermatology. Use items that are water resistant and broad spectrum, which means they prevent UVA and UVB rays. Reapply sunscreen every two hours, or more frequently if you're swimming or perspiring. Apply sunscreen liberally. \\n\\n3. Use moisturizers: Although they can't stop wrinkles from forming, moisturisers can temporarily hide fine lines and creases by holding water in the skin.\\n\\n4. Don't smoke: The blood vessels in the topmost layers of your skin become narrowed as a result of smoking. Collagen and elastin, the fibres that give your skin strength and elasticity, are also harmed by it. Skin starts to sag and wrinkle as a result before it should. Even if you've smoked for a long time or frequently, stopping smoking will still enhance the texture and tone of your skin and delay the appearance of wrinkles.\\n\\n5. Eat a healthy, well-balanced diet: According to the results of a few studies, eating a lot of fresh fruits and vegetables may help avoid the harm that causes early skin ageing. Research findings also point to the possibility that a diet high in sugar or other refined carbs may hasten ageing.\\n\\nA dermatologist can assist you in developing a customised skin care regimen by determining your skin type, assessing the health of your skin, and recommending products that are likely to be successful. A dermatologist can suggest prescription creams, botulinum toxin (Botox) injections, or skin-resurfacing procedures if you want more dramatic results from your wrinkle treatments.",

The oldest science, Ayurveda, which promotes the use of natural face packs for healthy, glowing skin, is the source of this age-old knowledge that has been handed down through the years. Face Packs Based On The Skin Types Everybody has a different type of skin. The product that does wonders for your friend's skin might not work as well for you. Even Ayurveda advises using skincare items that are appropriate for our skin types.\\n\\nHere are three different face packs for dry, oily, and normal skin types.\\n\\n1. Curd and Gram Flour Face Pack For Dry Skin</br>Using the Curd and Besan face pack is a fantastic way to nourish your dry skin. The Besan helps in removing all of your dead cells while the Curd deeply moisturizes the skin.</br>What You Will Need:\\n• Two tablespoons of Besan• One tablespoon of Curd\\n• One teaspoon of Honey\\n• A dash of Turmeric\\n\\nWhat You Have To Do?\\nTake a glass bowl and mix all the four ingredients to make a smooth paste.

Besan and Honey deeply cleanse your skin, Curd helps in moisturizing and turmeric works as an antiseptic which maintains the pH levels of your skin. Therefore, all the ingredients put together can do wonders on dry skin.\\nYour skin is thoroughly cleansed by besan and honey, moisturised by curd, and has its pH levels maintained by turmeric's antibacterial properties. The combination of all the components might therefore work wonders for dry skin.\\n\\n2. A face mask with lemon and honey for oily skin\\nLemon is a fantastic skin-cleansing agent that also helps to get rid of dead skin cells and lessen oil production. With all of its antiseptic and antibacterial qualities, honey aids in preventing breakouts of acne and pimples by lowering oil output.

Besan is a great exfoliator that aids in eliminating dead skin cells and providing the skin with a deep clean. It also aids in keeping your skin's pH balance in check.\\n\\nWhat you need is:\\n• Besan, one tablespoon\\n• 0.5 tablespoons of ground turmeric\\n• One tablespoon of rose water is all that is required.\\n\\nMake a thick paste by combining all three ingredients. Apply it next to your entire face and neck, then wait for around 15 minutes. Rinse it off completely now.\\n\\nAll of these recipes use natural ingredients, but it doesn't imply they are completely safe for you because you could have an allergy to any of the ingredients. Therefore, it is essential to perform a patch test on your hand before using them. If any ingredient is causing allergic reactions of any type, cease using it right once and seek medical attention if it becomes serious.",

If no moisturiser or skin cream is applied after washing, it usually feels \"tight\" and uncomfortable. Skin that is severely dry and dehydrated will crack and chap.",
    content: "1. Wash your face gently at least twice per day: Use a mild, alcohol- free, nonfoaming cleanser on your face twice day and right after you've worked up a sweat. Your skin can be repaired with products that include linoleic acid or stearic acid, which are both present in argan oil and shea butter, respectively. If you have sensitive skin, wash in the evening with a cleanser and simply rinse the rest of the time.\\n\\n2. Maintain Moisture : Keep your natural oils in place. Your skin naturally creates oils to protect it from the environment and keep it from drying out. But throughout the day, you engage in numerous activities that remove these natural oils. Your bathing habits pose the biggest risk to the natural defence system of your skin. Your skin is at risk from both soaps that remove too much oil from your skin and water that is too hot. Shower at the coolest setting you can tolerate, and only use soaps that say \"sensitive skin\" or contain moisturizers.\\n<b>Precautions:</b> Make cautious not to bathe too frequently or for too long. Both have the potential to remove too much of your natural oil. Take only one shower every day, for no longer than 10-15 minutes. Bathe only every other day if you can.\\n\\n3. Use a moisturising soap devoid of allergens: Use hypoallergenic (fragrance-free) moisturising soap when washing your hands. Then, while your hands are still damp, apply a moisturising cream. Try using a non-soap cleansing cream or shower gel in the shower or bath, and only use soap in places like the groyne and armpits when necessary. Avoid using pumice stones and loofahs. Rinse well, then pat yourself dry.\\n\\n4. Use a humidifier: Indoor air that is hot and dry can parch delicate skin and make itchiness and peeling worse. You can add moisture to the air in your home by using a portable humidifier or one that is connected to your furnace. \\n\\n5. Pick materials that are gentle on your skin:Cotton and other natural fabrics help your skin to breathe. Despite being natural, wool can occasionally irritate even healthy skin. Use laundry detergents free of dyes and fragrances, which can both irritate your skin. The word \"free\" is frequently used in the names of these products. \\n\\n6. Relieve itchiness: Apply a clean, cool, wet cloth to the itchy area if dry skin is to blame. Applying an anti-itch lotion or ointment with at least 1% hydrocortisone may also be an option. Consult your doctor or a dermatologist about developing a customised skin care regimen depending on your skin type and any existing skin conditions if these steps fail to relieve your symptoms or if they worsen.",

We'll go over the specifics below so you'll be better prepared to create a skincare routine that works for your skin. If you want to know your skin type you can read the this blog.3",
    content: "Step-by-step skin care routine for oily skin:\\n\\n1. Cleanse : Both in the morning and at night, wash your face. Cleanse your skin before bed to remove the grime that has accumulated over the day. Additionally, you should always wash your face in the morning even if your skin feels super-fresh. Your skin creates oils and loses skin cells while you sleep. Your skin may become overly glossy and break out as a result of this. Make use of a cleanser made with oily skin in mind. To help remove sebum (also known as oil) from pores, Shah prefers a mild salicylic acid cleanser like CeraVe SA Cleanser.\\n\\n2. Exfoliate : Exfoliating is a great technique to clear your pores of oil, dirt, and dead skin cells. Alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) and beta hydroxy acid are two active chemicals in chemical exfoliants that remove dead skin cells (BHA). The AHA glycolic acid is better for oily skin. Salicylic acid, another staple of BHAs, is also suitable for oily skin. Just be careful not to overdo it and limit your exfoliation to no more than twice a week. Excessive exfoliation might result in dry, irritated, or red skin. Plan to exfoliate at night because some components leave you more vulnerable to sunburn.\\n\\n3. Apply treatment : Retinol influence on cell turnover, it is excellent for minimising the appearance of wrinkles and can help smooth out the texture of your skin. Retinol also has the added benefit of minimising pores and aiding in the treatment of acne. In general, using active ingredients-containing products excessively can irritate your skin (such as acids or retinol). Consequently, just use once day at most (and sometimes less). Since these activities frequently make your skin sensitive to sunlight, nighttime is typically preferable. Since acne is a problem that frequently affects people with oily skin, you might wish to try an acne treatment instead. Acne-fighting products that contain sulphur, salicylic acid, or benzoyl peroxide can assist.\\n\\n4. Moisturize : You might believe that giving oily skin more moisture will do more harm than good. But in real life, it's a crucial step in your oily skin care regimen. People with oily skin frequently prefer gel moisturizers. \\nIn general, oily skin can safely utilise moisturisers designed for acne- prone skin. Just be certain that your cream, gel, or lotion is:\\n• Noncomedogenic\\n• Oil-free\\n• Lightweight\\n• Water-based\\n• Free from harsh chemicals or fragrances\\n\\n5. Apply SPF : It doesn't matter what type of skin you have—always wear sunscreen. \\nYou should constantly apply an SPF 30 or greater in the morning, even on cloudy or rainy days. Just check the ingredient list to make sure nothing pore-clogging is included, such as:\\n• Avobenzones\\n• Oxyphenones\\n• Benzophenones\\n• Methoxycinnamate\\n• Para - aminobenzoic acid(PABA)\\n\\nThis is for oily skin but if you want to know skin care routine for other skin types the you can check it out here.",

For the dry, damaged or chemically treated hair \\nYour hair's lengths can be prone to dryness and brittleness by nature. Additionally, if you've used chemical treatments to colour or straighten your hair, your hair may be more vulnerable to damage because it will be more sensitive to environmental pressures like pollution or photodamage. To nourish your damaged locks, use a shampoo that is protein-fortified and hair-strengthening. Amino acids and soy extracts are excellent for keeping coloured hair. To avoid drying out and colour loss, be careful to choose sulfate-free choices. \\n\\n3. Rough Hair \\nYou need to wash your hair more frequently if you have rough hair. Choose a creamy, moisturising shampoo if you plan to use excessive amounts of hair product. Such ingredients like shea, coconut, or olive butter should be sought for. You should pick your conditioner carefully in addition to your shampoo. You should pick a conditioner that is especially moisturising since it will coat your hair and keep moisture inside, giving you soft hair. \\n\\n4. Frizzy Hair \\nChoose moisturising, low-foaming, and sulfate-free shampoos if you want to prevent frizz. To replace the moisture lost, search for silicones and proteins that have been added to your shampoo. \\n\\n5. Fine Hair \\nIf you have thin hair, you should use thickening products, but they shouldn't be too creamy or heavy. Choose goods that will give you a lot of volume. For the best benefits, you should also wash your hair frequently. \\n\\n6. Oily Hair \\nUse a shampoo that removes oil from the hair strands, tones the scalp, and avoids clogged follicles if you have oily hair. Choose goods with high concentrations of astringent and thickening components like panthenol and wheat protein. \\n\\n7. Coloured Hair \\nChemically treated hair need more tender loving care. Choose a shampoo that keeps your hair's radiance intact, shields it from the sun, and stops the colour from fading. It is preferable if your items contain UV filters to stop the colour from fading. One of the most important steps in your hair care routine is washing your hair with the appropriate shampoo. Shampoos have an impact on both your scalp and individual hair strands. \\nAs a result, you should determine what kind of scalp and hair you have and select a shampoo accordingly. To address your unique hair difficulties, a number of shampoos and conditioners are readily available on the market. To choose the best shampoo, you can do your own research or speak with a professional.",

    intro: "Combination skin might be challenging to take care of, but it is not impossible. To properly care for mixed skin, you must discover products that are effective on the various skin types present on your face and do not irritate it.",
    content: "You can care by using these natural remedies:\\n\\n1. Maintain a regular skin-care routine: Developing a daily and nightly skin care routine is essential for managing mixed skin. To help your skin adjust to the regimen, use the same products 1-2 times a day for at least a month.\\n• Use a cleanser to wash your face once or twice every day. \\n• Exfoliate seldom, occasionally just once each week. \\n• Use a moisturiser to seal the deal every morning and night.\\n\\n2. Consider treating various facial regions: You will need to concentrate on treating two skin types with this skin type. You must moisturise the dry parts of your face and cut back on the extra oil on the oily parts. Your T-zone is frequently the greasy region of your face (your forehead, nose, above your mouth, and chin). \\nDepending on your skin type, you will need to treat particular sections of your face as opposed to your entire face with one product. Use a spot treatment to target the oil only on your forehead, for instance, if you have a breakout on your forehead and are aware that this area is prone to oiliness. Use a moisturising product exclusively on the area of your cheeks where your skin is prone to becoming dry and irritated. \\n\\n3. On dry skin, use an oil-based cleanser: Coconut oil and olive oil- based cleansers are excellent for dry to very dry skin and may only be effective on the dry patches of combination skin. Although oil-based cleansers are not harmful to your skin, oily skin is not advised to use them. For a test period, you might want to try preparing a variety of various oil-based cleansers. Use a professional cleanser that has additional substances to more effectively treat oily skin if you begin to break out or experience adverse reactions. \\n\\n4. A natural exfoliant can be made: After washing your face, you can exfoliate your skin to remove dead skin cells, especially if there are any dry or dead skin cell-filled areas of your face. Exfoliating will help stop pores from getting clogged and skin from looking lifeless. Once or twice a week, begin by exfoliating with a homemade scrub. \\n\\n5. Use a natural spot remedy: Use spot treatments to get rid of blemishes and stop new acne from developing in your T-zone. By doing so, you will be able to focus on your face's acne-prone areas while avoiding bothering other areas. \\n\\n6. Use organic face wash: Once a week, use a face mask to offer your skin a soothing treatment and a fresher complexion. Several organic, all- natural face masks combine oils and fruits to create a fantastic paste for your face. • Blend together two carrots, a banana, half a papaya, and a cup of honey. The ingredients should be combined to create a thick paste. For 20 minutes, apply this paste to your face. After that, wash it off with warm water. \\n• One tablespoon of natural yoghurt, one teaspoon of lemon juice, and two drops of lemon essential oil can be used to make a lemon yoghurt face mask. Spend ten minutes covering your face with the mask. After that, remove it with warm water. \\n\\nThis is how you can take care of your combination skin but in case you face any problem you should talk to your dermatologist."

    intro: "We are becoming more and more aware that COVID-19 affects the body in ways other than just the lungs as the pandemic spreads. The skin is a part of that. There have been complaints of various rashes, \"COVID toes,\" hair loss, and other skin issues. While some skin signs emerge later or in cases of more severe disease, others first show up shortly after an infection. Most people improve over time. Additionally, researchers are starting to figure out what triggers various skin problems, such as hormones or the body's immune response to an infection.",
    content: "From the most typical to the least, here are some of these signs:\\n\\n1. Several flat red areas and numerous small, spreading red pimples: These'maculopapular eruptions' are linked to more serious illness. \\n\\n2. Redness of the eye whites: This conjunctivitis is more prevalent in more advanced disease and in disease that is more severe. \\n\\n3. \"COVID toes,\" or symptoms resembling chilblains: These can affect either the hands or the feet, or both at once. Small blisters or pustules can occasionally be seen along with the reddish-purple discoloured skin, which can also be unpleasant and itchy. Children are more likely to get these chilblain-like lesions because they frequently manifest later in the illness, following other symptoms. \\n\\n4. Hives or urticaria are blotchy, elevated red lumps or pink or red, itchy rashes (wheals). Pinhead to dinner plate size, they come in a variety of shapes. Swellings may come and go, but they often go away in one area between minutes to hours. Hives often disappear in ten days. They appear simultaneously with other symptoms, affect people of all ages, and are linked to diseases that are more severe. \\n\\n5. Vesicular eruptions, also known as water blisters, are tiny fluid- filled micro-blisters that can develop at any time and are frequently found on the hands. Middle-aged patients typically experience pain. The blisters are indicative of an illness with a medium severity and last slightly over 10 days. \\n\\n<b>How do I know if my skin rash is COVID-19? </b>\\nCompare your skin symptoms to the pictures in this post if you have any concerns. Then, for more guidance, schedule a telemedicine session with your general practitioner or dermatologist. You might spread diseases. Get tested, then isolate yourself until you learn the results. Your GP or COVID clinic will be able to plan your care if you're feeling under the weather.",
